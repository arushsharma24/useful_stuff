A repository of useful resources and tools while trying to contribute to hacktoberfest 21

My current plans involve having: 
    
    - shell scripts
    
    - code templates
    
    - links to resources
   
    - simple tips in some docs
    
    - movies
    
    - quantum computing
    
    - internship resourses (along with solutions of questions)
